## Overview

The project is a tool that aims to help Banking Correspondents in Loan Processes, focused on Housing Financing.

## How does it work?

On the data confirmation page, the CCA records the data received from the applicant(s), and depending on the data, the tool informs what is or is not pending and what needs to be presented or evaluated regarding its use in the process.

It is possible to generate and download a .txt file with the applicants' main data (name, CPF, date of birth, telephone number and email). It is also possible to edit and later download a report on the process. The document pending items identified by the tool appear in the "Pending Items" field, which can be edited, copied or downloaded (the generated file is in .txt format).

The query page contains all the main links that a Correspondent uses in their day-to-day to verify and validate financing and loan processes.

When disconnecting, it is possible to create a file with the information necessary to request evaluation and disconnection reports for internalized processes.
