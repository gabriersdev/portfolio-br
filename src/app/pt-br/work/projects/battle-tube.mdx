## Overview

This is a project to allow users to choose the best clip on a Twitch channel. Using data obtained through the platform's API, the clips are displayed in a list of pairs so that users can vote for their favorite.

There are six rounds in total. For it to work correctly, it was necessary to obtain 64 clips. The selection criterion at this stage was the popularity of the clips, that is, the most viewed clips on the channel. After selection, all clips were analyzed and those that were not suitable for the project were removed and replaced by subsequent ones, totaling 64 clips.

Later, it will be possible to add new clips and rounds and the code adapted for use by other communities will be made available in the project's original repository.
